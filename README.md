Todo App with a twist.

- You can specify the quantity for a task by adding a number after the task name.
- This number indicates how many times the task should be added to the list.
For instance, "Write code 3" means the task "Write code" will be added to the list three times.
- You should be able to delete the task, by clicking the delete icon.
- Each time you update a task, it should be saved to a counter.
- The specific count should be displayed after the list item.
